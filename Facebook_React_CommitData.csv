* Use the memoized props/state from the workInProgress

We don't want to use the ""current"" props/state because if we have
started work, then pause and continue then we'll have the newer
props/state on it already. If it is not a resume, it should be the
same as current.

* Deprioritize setState within a deprioritized tree

Currently we flag the path to a setState as a higher priority
than ""offscreen"". When we reconcile down this tree we bail out
if it is a hidden node. However, in the case that node is already
completed we don't hit that bail out path. We end up doing the
work immediately which ends up committing that part of the tree
at a higher priority.

This ensures that we don't let a deprioritized subtree get
reconciled at a higher priority.

* Bump idx in unit test

This proves that this number is actually deprioritized."

I moved the updater to a new class component file. I suspect we

It doesn't yet track side-effects like insert/move/delete but has

The goal of this algorithm is to branch early and avoid rechecking those conditions. That leads to some duplications of code.

There are three major branches:

- Reconciling a single child per type.
- Reconciling all children that are in the same slot as before from the beginning.
- Adding remaining children to a temporary Map and reconciling them by scanning the map.

Even when we use the Map strategy we have to scan the linked list to line up ""same slot"" positions because React, unlike Inferno, can have implicit keys interleaved with explicit keys."

* Introduce facts-tracker

We want to be able to track various things like number of files that are flowified, number of tests passing with Fiber...

This introduces a tool that lets you do that. The API is very simple, you execute the script with a list of tuples [key value] and it's going to create a `facts` branch and put a txt file for each fact and values over time.

```
node scripts/facts-tracker/index.js \
  ""flow-files"" ""$COUNT_WITH_FLOW/$COUNT_ALL_FILES""
```

Test Plan:
This is tricky to test because Travis only exposes the private variables (github token) when it processes a committed file and not on branches. The reason is that otherwise anyone could send a pull requests that does `echo $GITHUB_TOKEN` and steal your token.

Given this constraint, I did all the work using two of my repos:
- https://github.com/vjeux/facts-tracker
- https://github.com/vjeux/facts-tracker-test

and am sending this pull request that should work as is /fingers crossed/, but we won't be able to test it out until it is committed.

Note that once this lands, I'm going to kill those two repos.

* Update with all the suggested changes

* Branch on a flow type in travis.yml

* Use $GITHUB_TOKEN

* properly escape it"

* High priority work

Adds the ability to schedule and perform high priority work. In the
noop renderer, this is exposed using a method `performHighPriWork(fn)`
where the function is executed and all updates in that scope are given
high priority.

To do this, the scheduler keeps track of a default priority level.
A new function `performWithPriority(priority, fn)` changes the default
priority before calling the function, then resets it afterwards.

* Rename overloaded priority terms

""High"" and ""low"" priority are overloaded terms. There are priority
levels called HighPriority and LowPriority. Meanwhile, there are
functions called {perform,schedule}HighPriWork, which corresponds
to requestAnimationFrame, and {perform,schedule}LowPriWork, which
corresponds to requestIdleCallback. But in fact, work that has
HighPriority is meant to be scheduled with requestIdleCallback.
This is super confusing.

To address this, {perform,schedule}HighPriWork has been renamed
to {perform,schedule}AnimationWork, and
{perform,schedule}LowPriWork has been renamed to
{perform,schedule}DeferredWork. HighPriority and LowPriority
remain the same.

* Priority levels merge fix"

the highest priority is. This is inefficient for large sets but
we can try to find a smarter way to do this later. E.g. passing
it down the stack.

This bug fix revealed another bug that I had flagged before that
we're finding work to do in the ""current"" tree instead of the

The issue in TapEventPlugin is that the code is accessing one of four
possible properties on the 'Touch' type native event using the bracket
accessor. Classes in Flow don't support using the bracket accessor,
unless you use a declaration and the syntax `[key: Type]: Type`.[1] The
downside of using that here is that we create a global type, which we
may not need in other files.

Other options:
- Use looser typing or a '@FixMe' comment and open an issue with Flow to
  support indexing on regular classes.
- Rewrite TapEventPlugin to not use the bracket accessor on 'Touch'. I
  thought the current implementation was elegant and didn't want to
  change it. But we could do something like this:
```
 if (nativeEvent.pageX || nativeEvent.pageY) {
   return axis.page === 'pageX' ? nativeEvent.pageX : nativeEvent.pageY;
 } else {
   var clientAxis = axis.client === 'clientX' ? nativeEvent.clientX : nativeEvent.clientY;
   return nativeEvent[axis.client] + ViewportMetrics[axis.envScroll];
 }
```"

This commit takes the first incremental step towards adding type checks
to the React event code. A couple of issues came up.

There is an issue with the SyntheticEvent type: Flow declares a
SyntheticEvent type[1] that lacks the non-public properties which are
used in React internals. To solve this I declared a class that extends
SyntheticEvent. This class can be expanded as we add Flow types to more
places where SyntheticEvent instances are referenced.

I'm happy to change this if folks prefer a different approach.
Some options I considered:
- Override the SyntheticEvent declaration with our own declaration
  - Pro: We can use 'SyntheticEvent' as a type just like we are used to
    when working in any other codebase.
  - Pro: No need to import any type since it's a declaration
  - Pro: Only one version of SyntheticEvent; less confusion.
  - Con: Could get out of sync with real implementation.
  - Con: Duplicates part of the type declared in Flow.
- Import the SyntheticEvent class and use that as the type
  - Pro: Keeps type definition in sync with the real implementation.
  - Con: Declaration overrides implementation so I'm not sure this would
    work.
  - Con: Have to remember to import the type.
- Declare a separate type called ReactSyntheticEvent that extends
  SyntheticEvent
  - Pro: Stays in sync with the Flow SyntheticEvent type;
    less duplication.
  - Pro: Differentiates this type from the Flow SyntheticEvent type;
    less confusion.
  - Pro: No need to import any type since it's a declaration
  - Con: Could get out of sync with real implementation.

I also ran into an issue where a variable was only non-null when
'__DEV__' is true, similar to PR #7586.[2] The work-around is to force
it to be typed non-null and add a comment documenting the reason. At
this time Flow doesn't have a better way to deal with the situation.

Next steps:
- Specific type for the 'dispatchConfig' property of SyntheticEvent
- More detailed types for PluginName and PluginModule

Lastly; note that I renamed some variables to follow the convention of
reserving PascalCase for classes, enums, and Flow types.

Instead of duplicating the logic, I used the $Enum feature of flow that lets us statically extract out the type from the dynamic value.

This one is interesting because we have transaction objects being passed around everywhere in the codebase but there's actually no Transaction class. It's a ""mixin"" that comes to life by being Object.assigned to the prototype of a real ""class"" (before class was cool!). Therefore, we can't just say `var Transaction = require('Transaction'); (transaction: Transaction) => { }` because it would be the object that contains a mixin and not an instance of a transaction.

The trick I use is to export `TransactionType` and alias it to `Transaction` in the file as it doesn't actually require transaction. In case they do, we'll figure it out, but in the few files I looked at, it doesn't seem to be the case.

For the perform function, it actually typechecks pretty well!"

This one involves a bit more work as I added ""phantom"" flow types to a bunch of places where the type is a ReactPropTypeLocations even though those files are not `@flow` yet.

A good side effect is that `ReactPropTypeLocationNames` keys are now correctly typed, this means that they cannot go out of sync without breaking flow :)"

Flow doesn't really support the concept of variables that are non-null but only inside of a `__DEV__` block. There's an internal post about it ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/flowtype/permalink/1132437726804841/ ) and the conclusion is that we should force it to be non-null and trust the developer to put the proper DEV checks in place."

I need a way to run the Fiber tests against it. But I don't want
to take on any package dependencies on Fiber modules yet.

There's a problem with jest right now where you can't globally
mock modules that already exist. So I have to add a global call
to jest.mock.

Luckily we already have a way to test the useCreateElement paths
using a feature flag. I won't activate this flag in travis until
it passes, but the idea is to run all three variants in travis.

I'm not sure that invoking rAF and rIC synchronously is the best
way to test this since it doesn't capture the backwards
compatibility aspect. I.e. the fact that people might be relying
on the synchronous nature in real apps too. It's a start.

Ideally, jest would have these built-in."

* Cut out isomorphic dependencies from the renderers

These files reaches into isomorphic files.

The ReactElement functions are exposed on the React object anyway
so I can just use those instead.

I also found some files that are not shared that should be in

renderSubtreeIntoContainer is only used by the DOM renderer.
It's not an addon.

ReactClass isn't needed as a dependency since injection doesn't
happen anymore.

* Use a shim file to load addons' dependencies on DOM

By replacing this intermediate file we can do the lazy loading
without needing any lazy requires. This set up works with ES
modules.

We could also replace the globalShim thing with aliased files
instead for consistency.

* Bundle DOM renderers into their individual UMD bundles

Instead of exposing the entire DOM renderer on the react.js
package, I only expose CurrentOwner and ComponentTreeDevtool which
are currently the only two modules that share __state__ with the
renderers.

Then I package each renderer in its own package. That could allow
us to drop more server dependencies from the client package. It
will also allow us to ship fiber as a separate renderer.

The total size for react.min.js + react-dom.min.js is +19kb larger
because of the overlap between them right now. I'd like to see
what an optimizing compiler can do to this. Some of that is fbjs
stuff. There shouldn't need to be that much overlap so that's
something we can hunt. We should keep isomorphic absolutely
minimal so there's no reason for other React clones not to use it.
There will be less overlap with Fiber.

However, another strategy that we could do is package the
isomorphic package into each renderer bundle and conditionally
initialize it if it hasn't already been initialized. That way
you only pay an overlap tax when there are two renderers on the
page but not without it. It's also easier to just pull in one
package. The downside is the versioning stuff that the separate
npm package would solve. That applies to CDNs as well.

ReactWithAddons is a bit weird because it is packaged into the
isomorphic package but has a bunch of DOM dependencies. So we have
to load them lazily since the DOM package gets initialized after."

This took a while to figure out, but we need to be able to store
children that are currently being worked on separately from the
current children. We always need a canonical ""current"" children
so that we can update them. However, we also need a different set
that we're currently working on so that we have a way to get to
already progressed work.

This solve the starvation problem in the first render because now
we can reach children that were never rendered and have a place
to store their progressed work on. The unit test changes tests
this.

This lets us get rid of the hasWorkInProgress flag.

When we reconcile new children we need to reconcile them against
progressed work so that we can reuse it. The progressed work is
""work in progress"" nodes. So in that case we need to mutate
instead of clone, to preserve the invariant that only two versions
exist at any given point. This effectively forks the
ReactChildFiber implementation."

* PropTypes: distinguish nullable from optional object field

This gives a more precise message (no type semantics change) to the case of passing a field in an object, but whose value is `null`:

Before:

```js
propTypes: {
  foo: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired
}
```

Would scream ""Required prop `foo` was not specified in `MyComp`"".

Now it'll be ""Required prop `foo` was specified in `MyComp`, but its value is `null`."".

Works as expected in nested objects.

This fixes the issue of a component transitively passing a `null`, specifying the correct field to the child but have the child tell it that it didn't provide the prop.

Optional field and nullable are two different things anyway.

Full list of changes is at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/2-to-3/. The tl;dr of it is:
 - Relative permalinks were removed, so all the files in the `docs` subdirectory need their permalink to be prefixed with `docs/`
 - `post` and `page` types were renamed to `posts` and `pages` respectively
 - `jekyll-paginate`, `pygments` and `redcarpet` are all now optional, so I needed to explicitly add it to the Gemfile. Jekyll now uses `rouge` rather than `pygments` for syntax highlighting, but rouge does not support highlighting individual lines (`hl_lines`) so we need to continue using Pygments.
 - Layout metadata (eg. `sectionid`) is now on a `layout` variable rather than `page`

Tested the following pages and confirmed that they all work:
 - ""Docs"" link (getting started page): http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/docs/getting-started.html
 - Downloads: http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/downloads.html
 - Tutorial: http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/docs/tutorial.html
 - A few pages under the ""docs"" subdirectory, to confirm they're working properly:
    - http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/docs/addons.html
 - http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/docs/why-react.html
 - http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/docs/create-fragment.html
 - A few tips:

 - http://127.0.0.1:4000/react/tips/style-props-value-px.html

Previously, the extract-components script would create the same number of layers of composites as the page it captures, but it would output a new class for each time any composite is used (since we don't want to replicate all the component logic).

I changed the script to output a single type for each type in the input -- and each generated component takes an index for which output it should return. This should be closer to how the original code behaves, especially with respect to VM function call lookups where the amount of polymorphism makes a difference.

I re-recorded the benchmarks with the new scripts. They run significantly faster:

```
Comparing old.txt (control) vs new.txt (test)
Significant differences marked by ***
% change from control to test, with 99% CIs:

* ssr_pe_cold_ms_jsc_jit
    % change: -41.73% [-43.37%, -40.09%]  ***
    means: 39.3191 (control), 22.9127 (test)
* ssr_pe_cold_ms_jsc_nojit
    % change: -44.24% [-46.69%, -41.80%]  ***
    means: 45.8646 (control), 25.5764 (test)
* ssr_pe_cold_ms_node
    % change: -45.61% [-47.38%, -43.85%]  ***
    means: 90.1118 (control), 49.0116 (test)
```

This is probably in part due to the changes here, but also the page I captured has changed somewhat in the meantime and there seem to be slightly fewer components in the hierarchy, so they're not really comparable. But going forward we can use this benchmark which should be more accurate. I also included an identical copy that uses stateless functional components so we can test optimizations to those later."

Summary:

I had to cast into any because flow doesn't think that checking the lowercase version of nodeName is a valid way to refine the variable from HTMLElement to HTMLInputElement. I'm also not confident enough in changing the implementation to an instanceof HTMLInputElement to please flow. It also takes care of the null check in the process.

The `nodeName &&` condition wasn't useful since the two branches are checking it against concrete values and actually makes the type different since nodeName is not a boolean per se. I replaced them with if conditions to make it clearer what it actually did instead of doing boolean logic tricks.

It is unclear why I had to type supportedInputTypes, see this internal post for a discussion: https://www.facebook.com/groups/flowtype/permalink/1084168611631753/

The only difference in behavior is that I now explicitely convert to boolean the object dereference via `!!`.

* Resolve refs in the order of the children

React makes no guarantees about ref resolution order. Unfortunately, some of the internal Facebook component APIs (specifically, layer dialogs) currently depend on the ref resolution order. Specifically, the assumption is that if the layer dialog is placed as a last child, by the time it mounts or updates, the refs to any previously declared elements have been resolved.

With the current `ReactMultiChild`, this is *usually* the case but not always. Both initial mount and an update of all components satisfy this assumption: by the time a child mounts or updates, the previous children¡¯s refs have been resolved. The one scenario where it isn¡¯t true is when **a new child is mounted during an update**.

In this case, the `mountComponent()` call used to be delayed until `ReactMultiChild` processes the queue. However, this is inconsistent with how updates normally work: unlike mounting, updating and unmounting happens inside `ReactChildReconciler.updateChildren()` loop.

This PR changes the `mountComponent()` to be performed inside `ReactChildReconciler`, just like `receiveComponent()` and `unmountComponent()`, and thus ensures that `attachRef()` calls are enqueued in the order the children were processed, so by the time the next child flushes, the refs of the previous children have been resolved.

This is not ideal and will probably be broken by incremental reconciler in the future. However, since we are trying to get rid of mixins in the internal codebase, and layered components are one of the biggest blockers to that, it¡¯s lesser evil to temporarily make ref resolution order more strict until we have time to fix up the layer APIs to not rely on it, and are able to relax it again (which would be a breaking change).

Summary:
Trying to start adding flow types to files in React. I needed to add a script to package.json in order to run flow, flow-bin is already a dependency.

I had to rewrite the implementation a bit. Flow doesn't recognize

```
var currentIsArray = Array.isArray(current);
if (currentIsArray) {
  // not refined
}
```

but the following does work

```
if (Array.isArray(current)) {
  // refined
}
```

npm run-script flow
npm run-script test accumulate

This avoids using .alternate as much as possible and isolates it
to the root. For anything that is ""work in progress"" this happens
to be the same as the alternate field. To avoid an extra ""current""
field on work in progress fibers, we can just use the alternate.

The timing for when this is true might be a bit tricky to reason
about so I explicitly pass the current value everywhere from the
top. That way we can always change this in the future to use an
explicit field or we can try to maintain a parallel data
structure that remembers which was the ""current"" fiber for each
wip child."

These values represent fibers that are incomplete. In the current
model they're mutated in place. In a completely immutable model
they would need to be cloned for every step they make progress.
I.e. one where the child is still in this WIP state and one when
it is complete.

To clarify this I'll name them workInProgress while they're in
that state, which is also what Jordan did in his prototype."

This splits the Fiber type into Fiber and Instance. This could be
two different object instances to save memory. However, to avoid
GC thrash I merge them into one.

When ReactChildFiber reconciles children, it clones the previous
fiber. This creates a new tree for work-in-progress. The idea is
that once flushed, this new tree will be used at the root.

However, we know that we'll never need more than two trees
at a time. Therefore my clone function stores the clone on the
original. Effectively this creates a fiber pool.

Ideally, the .alternate field shouldn't be used outside of clone
so that everything can work with pure immutability. I cheat a bit
for now so I don't have to pass both trees everywhere.

ReactChildFiber is a bit hacky for reuse and doesn't solve all
cases. Will fix that once I try to get parity."

object.

* Don't count the time inside flushes towards lifecycle hooks

Fixes #6842.

We keep the existing behavior of testing for matching `onBeginLifeCycleTimer`/`onEndLifeCycleTimer` calls, but we push the current timer onto the stack if we enter a flush.
This solves an issue with portals which cause updates while a lifecycle timer is already running.

I chose to subtract the time spent in the flush from the time counted towards the lifecycle method because it would artificially inflate the ¡°total¡± time of the component due to all the components inside the portal, so it would skew the exclusive table.

One of the ReactMultiChildText tests renders 2145 roots (and even more components) and unmounts none of them. Now we don't loop through them all a bunch of times so the test takes 20 seconds instead of 60.

We should clean up instantiateReactComponent somehow so that the onSetDisplayName call isn't produced for the TopLevelWrapper, which should allow us to just store an array of unmountedIDs instead of a hash map so we at least don't have double maps. This change mirrors the old logic though.

`ReactDebugTool` used to only call `purgeUnmountedComponents()` while profiling, so information about unmounted instances kept accumulating when not profiling.

Additionally, unmounting in React Native and rendering to string did not correctly clean up the devtool.

Finally, the tests tested the wrong behavior and relied on explicit `purgeUnmountedComponent()` calls.

To fix this, we:

* Test specifically that unmounting is enough to clean up the tree devtool.
* Add missing `onBeginFlush` and `onEndFlush` calls to server and native rendering so `ReactDebugTool` knows when to copy the tree.

ReactDOMInput and a few other classes handle change event by scheduling updateWrapper() in an asap().
It gets executed after the batch, which confuses ReactPerf that expects all DOM writes to happen during a batch.
Since this implementation of ReactPerf relying on the stack is going away, let's plug the hole temporarily by ignoring DOM writes that occur during postponed updateWrapper(). In any case, they have no relation to actual calculations of wasted renders, as they don't occur due to updateComponent(), but rather due to onChange() special DOM behavior.

This fixes #5548"

There seems to be a bug with medikoo/es6-symbol where the global state
affects the implementation of the polyfill. I found this by running the

test`. I found that it passes when ran alone and failed when ran
collectively.

I did not find this buggy behavior with zloirock/core-js's
implementation of a polyfill for Symbol. Thus, removing I will keep the
more popular polyfill (core-js) and remove the buggy polyfill
(es6-symbol).

If you are reading this and can think of a confounding factor that is
causing this bug, please let me know and we can try to work together to
add support for medikoo/es6-symbol."

it's a polyfill. There are no object polyfills out there. (If there is,
ping me and I'll add support)

Instead of checking if Symbol is undefined, let's check if it's a
function instead since instanceof is depending that Symbol is already a
function."

This PR is the first in a series of pull requests split from the new `ReactPerf` implementation in #6046.

Here, we introduce a new module called `ReactDebugInstanceMap`. It will be used in `__DEV__` and, when the `__PROFILE__` gate is added, in the `__PROFILE__` builds. It will *not* be used in the production builds.

This module acts as a mapping between ¡°debug IDs¡± (a new concept) and the internal instances. Not to be confused with the existing `ReactInstanceMap` that maps internal instances to public instances.

What are the ¡°debug IDs¡± and why do we need them? Both the new `ReactPerf` and other consumers of the devtool API, such as React DevTools, need access to some data from the internal instances, such as the instance type display name, current props and children, and so on. Right now we let such tools access internal instances directly but this hurts our ability to refactor their implementations and burdens React DevTools with undesired implementation details such as having to support React ART in a special way.[1]

The purpose of adding `ReactDebugInstanceMap` is to only expose ¡°debug IDs¡± instead of the internal instances to any devtools. In a future RP, whenever there is an event such as mounting, updating, or unmounting a component, we will emit an event in `ReactDebugTool` with the debug ID of the instance. We will also add an introspection API that lets the consumer pass an ID and get the information about the current children, props, state, display name, and so on, without exposing the internal instances.

`ReactDebugInstanceMap` has a concept of ¡°registering¡± an instance. We plan to add the hooks that register an instance as soon as it is created, and unregister it during unmounting. It will only be possible to read information about the instance while it is still registered. If we add support for reparenting, we should be able to move the (un)registration code to different places in the component lifecycle without changing this code. The currently registered instances are held in the `registeredInstancesByIDs` dictionary.

There is also a reverse lookup dictionary called `allInstancesToIDs` which maps instances back to their IDs. It is implemented as a `WeakMap` so the keys are stable and we¡¯re not holding onto the unregistered instances. If we¡¯re not happy with `WeakMap`, one possible alternative would be to add a new field called `_debugID` to all the internal instances, but we don¡¯t want to do this in production. Using `WeakMap` seems like a simpler solution here (and stable IDs are a nice bonus). This, however, means that the `__DEV__` (and the future `__PROFILE__`) builds will only work in browsers that support our usage of `WeakMap`.

Algolia adds two inline styles

```css
  position: relative;
  vertical-align: top;
```

to the element once the script inserted at the end of the page runs which super slightly moves the header. The fix is to always apply those two rules this way it doesn't jump. I did not notice it on my machine because it doesn't move when custom fonts are not being used.

Test Plan:
- Open two tabs: reactjs.com and localhost:4000/react
- Click around on reactjs.com to prime the cache with the fonts
- Switch tabs and click around on localhost (but do not force refresh!)
- Now you get custom fonts loaded locally and it doesn't jump when you change tabs"

This makes things easier if we ever want to use more than one DOM node for a component. Notably, this is more convenient if we want to remove the wrappers around text components (since text nodes can be split and joined however a browser feels like) or if we want to support returning more than one element from render (#2127).

I left the old indexes so that implementations aren't forced to use the node/image if they prefer indices, because I'm not sure yet whether the changes corresponding to my rewrite of DOMChildrenOperations are easy or hard yet in React Native. (The tests pass with and without the DOMChildrenOperations changes here.)"

All attributes defined on SVG elements will now be passed directly regardless of the whitelist. The casing specified by user will be preserved, and setAttribute() will be used.

In the future we will remove support for the camel case aliases to the hyphenated attributes. For example, we currently map `strokeWidth` to `stroke-width` but this is now deprecated behind a warning. When we remove support for this we can remove some of the code paths introduced in this commit.

The purpose of this change is to stop maintaining a separate SVG property config. The config still exists for two purposes:

* Allow a migration path for deprecated camelcased versions of hyphenated SVG attributes
* Track special namespaced attributes (they still require a whitelist)

However it is no longer a blocker for using new non-namespaced SVG attributes, and users don't have to ask us to add them to the whitelist.

Fixes #1657"

I'm trying to use React with otto
(https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto), which is implemented in Go and
does not support lookaheads or backreferences in regular expressions.
(Unfortunately that *does* mean that otto isn't fully compatible with
the ECMA5 spec; but since this is the only lookahead I am aware of in
the React codebase, this change makes React once again compatible with
otto, and any other JS implementation that may not be fully compliant on
regular expressions).

As far as I can tell, the previous code replaced a sequence of slash
characters with one more slash than before. The new code avoids the
negative lookahead by matching any sequence of slash characters and then
using the special `$&` placeholder to replace the matched sequence with
the original sequence, plus one more slash."

According to react documentation it is advised to: 
NEVER mutate this.state directly, as calling setState() afterwards may replace the mutation you made. Treat this.state as if it were immutable.

In this particular case it is probably doesn't matter since setState is called directly after mutation, but it does provide a bad example of state mutation.

Another way of removing an item from an array can be `newItems = this.state.slice(0,i).concat(this.state.slice(i+1))` however the meaning can be less obvious to some."

This uses wall-clock time (for now) so it's noisier than alternatives
(cachegrind, CPU perf-counters), but it's still valuable. In a future diff we
can make it use those.

`measure.py` outputs something that `analyze.py` can understand, but you can use `analyze.py` without `measure.py` too. The file format is simple:

```
$ cat measurements.txt

We were shallow-rendering a component that used refs at FB so this can't go in as-is. It's a little unclear what we _should_ do though, since there is nothing to hold a ref to (since we're shallowly rendering) and we generally promise that child refs are resolved before a parent's componentDidMount. Also, changing shallow rendering to use the original `_renderValidatedComponent` (instead of `_renderValidatedComponentWithoutOwnerOrContext`) breaks tests because now the `_owner` field doesn't match up for `toEqual` (non-null in `getRenderOutput` but null if constructed in a test)."

- Set text content after creating hierarchy, like the text is a child. I should've done this originally but I guessed it wouldn't matter. I was wrong (~20% perf difference in IE11).
- IE throws when setting an enum-like property to an invalid value. I tried setting every property to the string 'a' and changed the ones that threw to be MUST_USE_ATTRIBUTE. I think these are all correct -- encType is the most suspicious one based on the existing comments but I tested in IE8 and it works fine as an attribute."

This is a temporary solution and can go away when we get rid of the giant ReactMount node hash map.

Works at least on a CentOS 7 machine after running `sudo yum install

The only globals you get are `print` and `PerfCounters`. No `console` nor the other globals provided by the `jsc` command-line tool (load, readFile, etc) though they're probably not hard to implement.

You can disable the JIT by setting the environment variable `JSC_useJIT=false`.

Test Plan:
```
~/local/react/scripts/perf-counters$ make
~/local/react/scripts/perf-counters$ build/jsc-perf <(echo 'PerfCounters.init(); var a = PerfCounters.getCounters().instructions; print(""moo""); var b = PerfCounters.getCounters().instructions; print(b - a);')

Use a Symbol to tag every ReactElement"
"2060","031fc24daeae6bcdc5e5f6959b778e1c2ed5f378","2015-09-10T06:19:00Z","Sebastian Markbage","sema@fb.com","sebmarkbage","Sebastian Markbage","sema@fb.com","sebmarkbage","Use a Symbol to tag every ReactElement

Fixes #3473

I tag each React element with `$$typeof: Symbol.for('react.element')`. We need
this to be able to safely distinguish these from plain objects that might have
come from user provided JSON.

The idiomatic JavaScript way of tagging an object is for it to inherent some
prototype and then use `instanceof` to test for it.

However, this has limitations since it doesn't work with value types which
require `typeof` checks. They also don't work across realms. Which is why there
are alternative tag checks like `Array.isArray` or the `toStringTag`. Another
problem is that different instances of React that might have been created not knowing about eachother. npm tends to make this kind of problem occur a lot.

Additionally, it is our hope that ReactElement will one day be specified in
terms of a ""Value Type"" style record instead of a plain Object.

This Value Types proposal by @nikomatsakis is currently on hold but does satisfy all these requirements:

https://github.com/nikomatsakis/typed-objects-explainer/blob/master/valuetypes.md#the-typeof-operator

Additionally, there is already a system for coordinating tags across module
systems and even realms in ES6. Namely using `Symbol.for`.

Currently these objects are not able to transfer between Workers but there is
nothing preventing that from being possible in the future. You could imagine
even `Symbol.for` working across Worker boundaries. You could also build a
system that coordinates Symbols and Value Types from server to client or through
serialized forms. That's beyond the scope of React itself, and if it was built
it seems like it would belong with the `Symbol` system. A system could override
the `Symbol.for('react.element')` to return a plain yet
cryptographically random or unique number. That would allow ReactElements to
pass through JSON without risking the XSS issue.

The fallback solution is a plain well-known number. This makes it unsafe with
regard to the XSS issue described in #3473. We could have used a much more
convoluted solution to protect against JSON specifically but that would require
some kind of significant coordination, or change the check to do a
`typeof element.$$typeof === 'function'` check which would not make it unique to
React. It seems cleaner to just use a fixed number since the protection is just
a secondary layer anyway. I'm not sure if this is the right tradeoff.

In short, if you want the XSS protection, use a proper Symbol polyfill.

Finally, the reason for calling it `$$typeof` is to avoid confusion with `.type`
and the use case is to add a tag that the `typeof` operator would refer to.
I would use `@@typeof` but that seems to deopt in JSC. I also don't use
`__typeof` because this is more than a framework private. It should really be
part of the polyfilling layer."

React components can be assigned a special property named `key`. Therefore, it's helpful to avoid the phrase ""key property"" unless you're talking about the `key` property :)

I'm not sold on the replacement phrase, though... I think it's solid, but two fancy words like ""fundamental"" and ""invariant"" next to each other just seem a bit unwelcoming xP then again, we're talking about some heavy technical stuff; if there aren't any lighter words that are equally precise, then these should probably stand."

As discussed in issue 1326
(https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1326) transitionend events are
unreliable; they may not fire because the element is no longer painted,
the browser tab is no longer focused or for a range of other reasons.
This is particularly harmful during leave transitions since the leaving
element will be permanently stuck in the DOM (and possibly visible).

The ReactCSSTransitionGroup now requires timeouts to be passed in
explicitly for each type of animation. Omitting the timeout duration
for a transition now triggers a PropTypes warning with a link to the
updated documentation."

Turns out jest is _incredibly_ slow at resolving require paths like `require('fbjs/lib/foo')`. Like several milliseconds per require. Really adds up when all our files require `invariant` and `warning`. Here's a temporary hack to make things fast again.

This wraps a proper guard around event dispatching so that errors doesn't
interupt other event callbacks.

Instead we rethrow the first error after all callbacks have been invoked.

For DEV mode we use native event dispatching if available. This has the
benefit that caught exceptions show up in the dev tools even without caught
exceptions being turned on. Yet, all callbacks are guaranteed to fire."

We keep track of the fact that something is rendering for a bunch of
warnings. (ReactCurrentOwner.current !== null)

Once we get rid of owner for string refs, I'll convert those to something
like ""isRendering"" instead. The interesting part is that feature `__DEV__`
only. It is only used for warnings. Except for this case.

This means that we can get rid of the special case for the isRendering
stack on in prod."

I think completely removing warnAndMonitorForKeyUse is a bit difficult, without
duplicating a ton of code. This at least ensures that the format string passed
to `warning` is unique. Plus, because the FB internal code in question only
matches the beginning of the format string, I think there should be zero
internal changes that need to be made to support this refactor."

The `warning` implementation checked that the message is long enough to

It makes more sense to move this into a lint rule, and also to apply it
for both `warning` and `invariant`. We can safely remove stuff from the
`warning` implementation as we replace the function internally anyways.

Checks that the *second* argument of warning and invariant are a literal

This commit also fixes a few places where the existing code had broken

The rule itself is pretty straightforward, although adding the tests
ended up being a bit painful, as eslint-tester depends on mocha, and
therefore needs to be run in a separate grunt task."

This heuristic isn't great because it relies on inspecting deep children which aren't guaranteed to be React elements. In particular, this was causing stack overflows in a component we had that used a *DOM node* as children, like `<DOMContainer>{node}</DOMContainer>`.

Reorganize Src Directory for Isomorphic React Package"
"2896","0b063f8a09dae4b6b1de400ff2d9aba9108647de","2015-05-16T01:35:22Z","Sebastian Markbage","sema@fb.com","sebmarkbage","Sebastian Markbage","sema@fb.com","sebmarkbage","Reorganize Src Files for Isomorphic React Package

The new folder structure is organized around major packages that are expected to ship separately in some form.

`/isomorphic`

I moved classic/modern and children utils into a directory called ""isomorphic"" with the main export being ReactIsomorphic. This will eventually become the ""react"" package.

This includes all the dependencies that you might need to create a component without dependencies on the renderer/reconciler.

The rest moves into decoupled renderers.

`/renderers/dom/client` - This is the main renderer for DOM.

`/renderers/dom/server` - This is the server-side renderer for HTML strings.

`/addons` and `/test` - Same as before for now.

You're not supposed to take on a dependency inside another package.

Shared code is organized into a ""shared"" directory which is intended to support all the packages in that subdirectory. Meaning that once we swap to CommonJS modules, the only time you should use `..` is to target `../shared/` or `../../shared`.

E.g. `/shared/` is common utils that are used by everything.

`/renderers/shared/` is code that is shared by all renderers, such as the main reconciliation algorithm.

Shared code will likely be copied into each package rather than referenced. This allow us to have separate state and allow inlining and deadcode elimination."

Update links to use https:// where it is supported. There's probably a lot
more that could be fixed, but these are the core ones I found (especially
the download links in order to prevent MITM attacks). Note that there are
some fb.me links that will redirect to http:// even while accessed over
https://, but this seemed like the best way to fix those for now.

NOTE: Only non-third-party files were modified. There are references to
http:// URLs in vendored/third-party files, but seems appropriate to fix
upstream for those rather than editing the files.

Also, copy one image locally to the blog, as it was hotlinking to a site
that did not support https://.

Last, use youtube-nocookie.com instead of youtube.com for video embeds,
as the former doesn't try to set a cookie on load (privacy enhancement)."

If there are no listeners for `onSelect` yet, do not extract events. This way we can avoid issues where listeners have been set up for some event dependencies for `SelectEventPlugin`, but not all.

For instance, if `topMouseDown` has been registered but not `topMouseUp`, event extraction will set the `mouseDown` flag to true but never unset it. This leads to bugs when `onSelect` is registered and should be firing during normal key behavior. Since no `topMouseUp` has yet occurred to unset the flag, `onSelect` fails to fire."

Turns out lots of people write invalid HTML all the time and no one, including your browser or React, cares. Most invalid HTML combinations don't cause magic reparented nodes; only some do. The HTML5 parsing spec (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html) specifies which tag combinations cause strange parsing behavior. I did my best to encode the logic here. It's more lenient than before in some cases, but more strict in others (before we didn't look at the whole stack of tags; now we warn with deeply nested `p` or `form` or `a` tags)."

Now that #1169 is fixed, the only thing this is used for is to determine whether `onTouchTap` causes touch listeners to be added. The only internal uses of TapEventPlugin are where touch events are already initialized (so this doesn't make a difference) and we don't support `onTouchTap` as part of the public API so this should be safe."

This reverts an early commit that made it so that elements from two

That behavior was helpful, and we did hit a case which was solved by this.
However, this pattern is extremely uncommon. I've yet to even find the
original case, let alone any existing cases in our codebase.

Therefore, we're dropping this to simplify elements and enable new
optimizations."

_mountImageIntoNode moved into ReactMount and wasn't being counted where it was supposed to be. In addition, all DOM elements are now wrapped in a composite wrapper but for the perf tools we want to skip over those or else we'll double-count (at least with the current accounting -- and that's effectively what we did before so this brings us back up to parity).

Summary:
Right now, if a component specifies a propType as, for example,
`myProp: React.PropTypes.shape`, without an actual shape
parameter, any prop type will be accepted, because
`React.PropTypes.shape` returns a function (the actual validator),
not an Error, currently indicating that propType checking passed.

This can create an unfortunate situation where a component looks
like it has fully specified `propTypes`, but in fact does not.

This commit addresses this by warning if a propType checker returns
anything non-falsy that is not an Error (currently all the library
PropTypes return null or an Error).

Test Plan:
Added a unit test; ran `jest` in the root repo directory.
Also ran `grunt lint` and `grunt test`"

This is a new version of cloneWithProps but this one is moving out of
add-ons. Unlike cloneWithProps, this one doesn't have special logic for
style, className and children.

This one also preserves the original ref. This is critical when upgrading
from a mutative pattern where a child might have a ref on it.

It also preserves context, which is similar to how context would work when

When animating the max-height property in Safari, entering the leave state would trigger an animation to `max-height: 0`. Then when the active state kicked in, it would jump and didn't really look right. Moving the `transition` css property to the active version fixed the issue for me and worked on Safari, Chrome and Firefox. Unfortunately I'm not in a position to test in IE at the moment, but I'll do that at my first convenience tomorrow."

Summary:
This section was confusing. I reworded it from:

""JSX is completely optional. You don't have to use JSX with React.
You can create these trees through `React.createElement`. The first
argument is the tag, pass a properties object as the second
argument and children to the third argument.""

to:

""JSX is completely optional; you don't have to use JSX with React.
You can create React elements in plain JavaScript using
`React.createElement`, which takes a tag name or component, a
properties object, and variable number of optional child
arguments.""

and additionally added another child element to the example code.

Eslint now allows us to use a different parser, which allows us to use
esprima-fb explicitly. This means we don't have to wait for espree to add
things like rest-param parsing. Though we do need eslint to upgrade its rules
to handle that AST.

I had hoped to enable parsing of our tests but we can't do that until we
change esprima-fb's XJS nodes to JSX.

While I was here, I also enabled the no-unused-vars rule since eslint
understands template strings. I also made the single quote enforcement
actually fail instead of just warn."

This triggers a warning if you try to pass a keyed object as a child.

You now have to wrap it in React.addons.createFragment(object) which
creates a proxy (in dev) which warns if it is accessed. The purpose of
this is to make these into opaque objects so that nobody relies on its
data structure.

After that we can turn it into a different data structure such as a
ReactFragment node or an iterable of flattened ReactElements."

I hit an issue related to this earlier today. Feels like a short paragraph warning of potential issues would be of benefit.  Discussed with @zpao on IRC, agreed to make PR.

Set state takes a function"

This diff enables setState to accept a function in addition to a state partial. If you provide a function, it will be called with the up-to-date `state, props, context` as arguments.

This enables some nicer syntax for complex setState patterns:

If setState is doing an increment and wants to guarantee atomicy, you need a function:

```
this.setState(state => ({ number: state.number + 1 }));
```

This atomicy is particularly important if setState is called multiple times in a single frame of execution as the result of complex user actions. It's a tricky bug to chase down and difficult to determine how to fix when you find it. The current pattern of reaching into _pendingState relies on an implementation detail.

In this example: props.doAction() may result in your ancestor re-rendering and providing you with new props. If setState is called directly with an object literal referencing `this.props`, it will use the *old* version of props, not the new value. Using a function solves for this case:

```
this.props.doAction();
this.setState((state, props) => ({ number: state.number * props.multiplier }));
```"

All entry points are for reconciliation are within batching strategies.

Since we don't have any batching strategies with synchronous updates,
there can't be more than one life-cycle method on the stack at any given
time.

Therefore, it's safe to move the composite life cycle flag to a singleton.
This saves us some memory management.

I think that we can get rid of these life cycle states completely in the
future."

Currently, the first setState that happens during initial render will

the setStates that happen within life-cycle methods are asynchronous."

I originally did this work so that we could allow setState to be called
before the internal ReactCompositeComponent was constructed. It's unlikely
that we'll go down that route now but this still seems like a better
abstraction. It communicates that this is not immediately updating an
object oriented class. It's just a queue which a minor optimization.
It also avoids bloating the ReactCompositeComponent file.

Since they both depend on the life cycle I break that out into a common
shared dependency. In a follow up I'll refactor the life-cycle management."

Instead of putting the shared code in a base class method, we use a wrapper
call around all invokations. That way they're free to add code before AND
after the non-shared code.

That way we ensure that component extensions don't need to implement
ReactComponentMixin and do super() calls into it. This helps to create a
tighter API for custom component extensions.

This provides the first step towards moving these methods to static
methods which allows to use a different dispatch mechanism instead of
virtual method calls. E.g. pattern matching."

As a consequence of this, we no longer have a mapping between the internal
representation and the public instance during the mounting process.
Because the constructor hasn't returned yet.

We used to have a special case for calling setState in getInitialState
which was just ignored. This makes that throw and the component is
considered unmounted during the construction phase."

This is the base class that will be used by ES6 classes.

I'm only moving setState and forceUpdate to this base class and the other
functions are disabled for modern classes as we're intending to deprecate
them. The base classes only have getters that warn if accessed. It's as if
they didn't exist.

ReactClass now extends ReactComponentBase but also adds the deprecated
methods. They are not yet fully deprecated on the ReactClass API.

I added some extra tests to composite component which we weren't testing
to avoid regressions.

I also added some test for ES6 classes. These are not testing the new
state initialization process. That's coming in a follow up."

This essentially copies all classic element creation tests to the modern
JSX tests. The classic tests doesn't use JSX and modern tests do.

The idea is that the JSX tests can start dropping dynamic checks once
we have Flow support for those features. JSX won't be necessary for
dropping dynamic checks. Plain object will also work. Flow will also not
be necessary for JSX. However, the tests should test for the suggested
combination (JSX + Flow).

This also moves some misplaced tests to ReactDOM and Validator.

Note that the modern tests uses ES6 classes. I will add separate tests for
those. However, these are not guaranteed to have .displayName so all our
error messages should check .name if available instead. This should be
better abstracted but I just adhoc fix this for now."

This moves ReactClass, ReactElement and ReactPropTypes into a legacy folder

These are ""classic"" because they are decoupled and can be replaced by
ES6 classes, JSX and Flow respectively.

This also extracts unit tests from ReactCompositeComponent, which was
terribly overloaded, into the new corresponding test suites.

There is one weird case for ReactContextValidator. This actually happens in
core, and technically belongs to ReactCompositeComponent. I'm not sure
we will be able to statically validate contexts so this might be a case
for dynamic checks even in the future. Leaving the unit tests in classic
until we can figure out what to do with them."

In order to improve support for Chinese and Japanese IME input in
Internet Explorer, use a fallback composition state to determine
inserted text. IE composition events are mostly okay, except for
certain punctuation characters that are ignored. Using the fallback, we
can detect these characters.

The fallback is also useful for emitting `beforeInput` events, so it
makes sense to simply combine these plugins.

This change also incorporates a recent change to the Google Input Tools
browser extension that exposes a `data` field via the `detail` object
on the custom composition events it emits."

ART, just like MultiChild adds an expando property to manage it's diffing
state. This is ugly and bad. We should be moving this state outside the
component for use by the diffing algorithm. This state is not needed by
components nested in composites, and varies by diffing algorithm.

It sucks that I have to add it to every component just to support ART,
but that's the quickest solution, other than disabling preventExtensions.

At least now we know that it sucks."

This separates the reconciliation step of children into a separate module.
This is the first step towards prerendering.

The stateful instances are reconciled and put into a ""rendered children""
set. Updates creates a new of these sets. These two sets are then diffed
to create insert/move/remove operations on the set.

The next step is to move the ReactChildReconciler step to before the
native DOM component. That way it's possible to rely on child
reconciliation without relying on diffing."

Summary:
After #2570, `mountDepth` is only used to enforce that `setProps` and `replaceProps` is only invoked on the top-level component. This replaces `mountDepth` with a simpler `isTopLevel` boolean set by `ReactMount` which reduces the surface area of the internal API and removes the need to thread `mountDepth` throughout React core.

Update Dirty Components in Mount Ordering"

Currently, `ReactUpdates` updates dirty components in increasing order of mount depth. However, mount depth is only relative to the component passed into `React.render`. This breaks down for components that invoke `React.render` as an implementation detail because the child components will be updated before the parent component.

This fixes the problem by using the order in which components are mounted (instead of their depth). The mount order transcends component trees (rooted at `React.render` calls).

Summary:
Currently, `ReactClass` mutates values returned by `getDefaultProps`, `getInitialState`, and `getChildContext`. This is bad because the objects may, for example, be cached and re-used across instances of a React component.

This changes `ReactClass` to instead create a new object. In return for allocating a new object, I've replaced `mapObject` with a `for ... in` so that we are no longer allocating an unused object.

Fair trade, IMO.

The bug was happening because this.state.children was used as a base for
children removal and it wasn't updated until the render, so only the last
removal was actually happening.

Fix involves keeping the updated children state between invocations of
_handleDoneLeaving. After updating this.state and rendering,
updatedState is cleaned up and ready for subsequent array modifications.

Fixes #2493, also closes #2353 as it incorporates a variant of that fix.

- Instead of having getEmptyComponent return `<noscript />` directly, wrap it in a class that we can easily identify later as being an empty component
- Cache the empty component element instead of recreating one each time
- Avoid touching the nullComponentIdsRegistry dictionary at all when not dealing with empty components
- Move empty-component tests to a separate file

ReactTextComponent's implementation is DOM-specific; instead of flattenChildren creating the ReactTextComponent instances, ReactNativeComponent now takes care of having ReactTextComponent injected and creating the component instance. I also renamed ReactTextComponent to ReactDOMTextComponent and moved it to browser/ui/ where it belongs. ReactDOMTextComponent no longer inherits directly from ReactComponent and instead implements construct and {mount,receive,unmount}Component directly.

This diff removes `ReactTestUtils.isTextComponent` which should have previously never returned true when using public APIs.

""appear"" differs from ""enter"" in that all children of a transition group at mount time will ""appear"" but will not ""enter"". All children later added to an existing transition group will ""enter"" but not ""appear"".

This extra transition phase allows for animation-on-mount effects.

A mirroring ""appear"" prop has been added to ReactCSSTransitionGroup, however for reverse-compatibility (and because ""appear"" is less common) it defaults to false.

Fixes #1392.

Previously, ReactComponent.updateComponent set the new props and owner and updated the component's refs. Because it did the actual props assignment, it had to be called by ReactCompositeComponent between componentWillMount and componentDidMount, meaning that it was skipped if shouldComponentUpdate returned false. Now, updateComponent takes the old and new descriptors and only updates refs, allowing a subclass to call updateComponent at a convenient time (specifically, it can be before `this._descriptor` is updated if the subclass also overrides performUpdateIfNecessary).

The new update cycle for composites is:

- receiveComponent is called which stores `this._pendingDescriptor` and calls performUpdateIfNecessary directly or a state update is enqueued, in which case ReactUpdates will call performUpdateIfNecessary
- performUpdateIfNecessary ensures that an update is still pending (which might no longer be the case if an update is queued for a subcomponent that was updated through a parent's reconciliation) and calls updateComponent with the old and new descriptors
- updateComponent calls super to update refs, then calls componentWillReceiveProps (if applicable) and shouldComponentUpdate -- if shouldComponentUpdate returns false, `this._descriptor`, `this.props`, and `this.state` are updated and the update is skipped; else, _performComponentUpdate is called
- _performComponentUpdate calls componentWillUpdate and _updateRenderedComponent, and enqueues the componentDidUpdate call (in that order)
- _updateRenderedComponent calls render and updates the rendered component appropriately

For DOM components (essentially unchanged):

- receiveComponent is called which does a short-circuit check for descriptor equality and delegates to super (which stores `this._pendingDescriptor` and calls performUpdateIfNecessary)
- performUpdateIfNecessary (not overridden) sets new values for `this.props`, etc. and calls updateComponent
- updateComponent does the DOM property and children updates (some synchronously, some queued for the transaction close)

For text and ART components (unchanged):

- receiveComponent updates the DOM or ART directly based on the new props
- updateComponent is never called

Notable changes:

- When shouldComponentUpdate returns false, refs are still updated
- ReactDefaultPerf now includes lifecycle methods in component timings
- updateComponent's signature changed (technically this is part of the public API, though we've never documented it)

This lets you use any kind of iterable as a container of react child elements. It also preserves keys when possible if the iterable is keyed.

 * Use an ES6 Map or Set to hold children.
 * Use an Immutable-js collection to hold children.
 * Use a function* which yields children.

Concretely, this removes the necessary conversion to JS objects if you're mapping over Immutable-js collections to get children, i.e.:

```
<div>
  {myImmutable.map(val => <span>{val}</span>).toJS()
</div>
```

Now we can remove the `toJS()` and the intermediate allocation along with it.

This also cleans up the traverseAllChildrenImpl method."

This makes ReactDOM a simple helper for creating ReactElements with the string tag as the type. The actual class is internal and created by instantiateReactComponent. Configurable using injection.

There's not a separate class for each tag. There's just a generic ReactDOMComponent which could take any tag name.

Edit the description of componentDidMount() to make clear that the function is called only once during the lifecycle of the component, after only the initial render() call. The description is now similar to that for componentWillMount(). The existing wording does not make it clear that the function is called only after the initial render. (Granted, it is possible to infer this from descriptions of the component lifecycle found elsewhere in the documentation, but I think explicit is better than implicit in this case)."

The HTMLtoJSX file is really a part of the React-Magic project, and should belong there rather than here:
 - It doesn't really follow the release cycle of React at all
 - It is totally standalone with no dependency on React
 - The only usage of this script is in React-Magic and on the HTML to JSX page on the React website (http://facebook.github.io/react/html-jsx.html)

I've hotlinked it from the Github site for that project since this was the easiest way to pull it in.

Due to the fact that Github Pages lacks redirects (among other basic web hosting functionality), I've replaced the `html-jsx-lib.js` file with a comment explaining where the file has moved to, just in case anyone was hotlinking it from the React site."

The biggest change: instead of calling functions directly, we now use

The other big change: this removes the need for the @jsx pragma.
Instead we'll parse everything, assume React is in scope,
and only look for the actual XJS parts in the AST (as opposed to only
runing the transform when @jsx was specified in the docblock).

Note: this is actually a series of commits internally and should have
been syned out in pieces over the past several weeks."

This moves all logic around legacy descriptors to ReactLegacyDescriptor. This
is responsible for the layer that knows that createClass exports a legacy
factory. When passed one of these classes, it unwraps it to be a real class.

If it is passed a non legacy factory, it is assumed to be a non-react component
that needs to be invoked as a plain function.

The semantic change is that a descriptor is now always returned if passed a
legacy factory. Even if that factory is a mock. A mock would previously return
undefined.

For mocks, I treat the factory as the authoritative function. I call it to extract
the instance or fill it with an empty component placeholder.

Additionally, I make the classes take props as the first argument to the
constructor. This is what the new class system will do.

We currently need to set up some internals by calling the internal construct
method. Instead of doing that automatically in the constructor, I now move that
to a second pass so that mocks can get the plain props.

This means that we can assert that a mock has been called once it's mounted
with it's final props. Instead of the descriptor factory being called."

When I first read these docs, it was not immediately clear to me that I could
use `React.addons.CSSTransitionGroup` to animate a single item coming into view,
or an item replacing an item already there. This was partly due to the example
which rendered a list of items.

This PR adds a blurb about being able to use
`React.addons.CSSTransitionGroup` with one or zero items, provides a code
example, and adds a note blockquote that a `key` attribute must always be
provided on each child of `React.addons.CSSTransitionGroup`. The latter point
was not immediately obvious from the original `TodoList` code example, since it
renders a list which would normally require `key` attributes anyway.

Test Plan:
- Refreshed `http://localhost:4000/react/docs/animation.html`, saw that the
  docs additions rendered correctly.
- Example code not tested (it was extracted from working code)."

Depends on #1758.

Fixes #1698.

Previously, controlled components would update too soon when using something like ReactLayeredComponentMixin (i.e., before the layer's updates could propagate from the parent), causing the cursor to jump even when always updating the new model value to match the DOM state. With this change, we defer the update until after all nested updates have had a chance to finish, which prevents the cursor from misbehaving.

Also cleaned up the logic around updating a bit -- the .value and .checked updates in ReactDOMInput weren't being relied on at all so I removed them and opted for a simple forceUpdate instead. I also got rid of _isChanging which hasn't been necessary since the introduction of update batching.

Test Plan: Tested the example in http://jsfiddle.net/Bobris/ZZtXn/2/ and verified that the cursor didn't jump. Changed the code to filter out numbers and verified that the field prevents typing numbers (attempting to do so still causes the cursor to jump to the end). Also verified that controlled and uncontrolled radio buttons, textareas, and select boxes work."

Breaking changes

- key/ref are no longer accessible on props but they are accessible on the
  descriptors. This means that parents/owners can access it but not the
  component itself.

- Descriptor factories are now plain functions and you can't rely on the
  prototype or constructors of descriptors to identify the component type.

Existing descriptor factories are now wrapped in a legacy factory. Currently it
does nothing but it will give us a hook to track callers to factories that are
not using JSX but just invoking the function directly. It also proxies static
methods/properties to the underlying class. The newer factories don't have this
feature.

ReactTextComponent has it's own little factory because it's props is not an
object. This is a detail and will go away once ReactTextComponent no longer
needs descriptors."

This copies the propType and contextType validation to a wrapper around the
descriptor factory. By doing the validation early, we make it easier to track
down bugs. It also prepares for static type checking which should be done at the
usage site.

This validation is not yet active and is just logged using monitorCodeUse. This
will allow us to clean up callsites which would fail this new type of
validation.

I chose to copy the validation of abstracting it out since this is just an
intermediate step to avoid spamming consoles. This makes more a much cleaner
diff review/history. The original validation in the instance will be deleted as
soon as we can turn on the warnings.

Additionally, getDefaultProps are moved to become a static function which is
only executed once. It should be moved to statics but we don't have a
convenient way to merge mixins in statics right now. Deferring to ES6 classes.

This is still a breaking change since you can return an object or array from
getDefaultProps, which later gets mutated and now the shared instance is
mutated. Mutating an object that is passed into you from props is highly
discouraged and likely to lead to subtle bugs anyway. So I'm not too worried.

The defaultProps will later be resolved in the descriptor factory. This will
enable a perf optimizations where we don't create an unnecessary object
allocation when you use default props. It also means that ReactChildren.map
has access to resolved properties which gives them consistent behavior whether
or not the default prop is specified."

This one was an actual behavioral bug rather than a bug with the tests; our intention was that the first element from the `defaultValue` array would remain selected but IE seemed to be choosing the last one instead. Now we set the value for uncontrolled components in componentDidUpdate when switching from multiple to non-multiple to ensure that a consistent option gets selected.

Not removing them resulted in leaks as we would hold on to removed nodes forever.

This really showed up with images and the load event where we would unmount and create a new img with the same react id as the old one. We properly cleared and primed the caches but we would handle the load event for both nodes. We would eventually hit an invariant in that path as we tried to handle the event for the removed node, which no longer matched the node we had in the cache.

This copies the propType and contextType validation to a wrapper around the
descriptor factory. By doing the validation early, we make it easier to track
down bugs. It also prepares for static type checking which should be done at the
usage site.

This validation is not yet active and is just logged using monitorCodeUse. This
will allow us to clean up callsites which would fail this new type of
validation.

I chose to copy the validation instead of abstracting it out to a common abstraction. This is just an
intermediate step to avoid spamming consoles. The original validation in the instance will be deleted as soon as we can turn on the warnings at the callsite. Copy+Delete makes this a more a much cleaner diff review/history.

Additionally, getDefaultProps are moved to become a static function which is
only executed once. It should be moved to statics but we don't have a
convenient way to merge mixins in statics right now. Deferring to ES6 classes.

This is still a breaking change since you can return an object or array from
getDefaultProps, which later gets mutated and now the shared instance is
mutated. Mutating an object that is passed into you from props is highly
discouraged and likely to lead to subtle bugs anyway. So I'm not too worried.

The defaultProps are now resolved in the descriptor factory. This will enable
a perf optimizations where we don't create an unnecessary object allocation
when you use default props. It also means that ReactChildren.map has access to
resolved properties which gives them consistent behavior whether or not the
default prop is specified.

This is a breaking change since it can affect how mapping over children and
transferPropsTo works together with defaultProps."

In IE10/11, it is apparently possible to have a Selection or Range object that has the following properties:

  - `anchorNode` === `focusNode` (Selection) or `startContainer` === `endContainer` (Range)
  - `anchorOffset` === `focusOffset` (Selection) or `startOffset` === `endOffset` (Range)
  - `isCollapsed` === `false` (Selection) or `collapsed` === `false` (Range)

As defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range/ranges.html, this doesn't really make sense. Since the nodes and offsets are the same, the ""collapsed"" value should be `true`.

Moreover, when calling `selection.toString()` in this case, it appears that the entire text contents of `body` -- including `<script>` tag contents -- are considered within the selection. I thought maybe the selected nodes were missing from the DOM or something, but no, they're there.

Sidestep all of this in `ReactDOMSelection` by calculating the `collapsed` property manually and setting the selection length directly to zero if it is actually collapsed.

Side note: I think that for selection restoration on contenteditables, we shouldn't try to do this offset calculation. We should just use the structure provided natively (nodes and offsets) since we can restore using that structure as well."

The `updatedChildren[j].parentNode.removeChild(updatedChildren[j]);` line below can fail if (1) we're moving/moving the same node twice or (2) the node we're looking for is gone completely. This makes it easier to distinguish between the two cases.

This uses the return value (an Error or nothing) to indicate whether a prop passes validation or not. It used to be done through calling `console.warn` as a side-effect, except this didn't work well with and `oneOfType`, which calls each validator.

The solution was to insert a `.weak` prop to each validator to suppress the warning message. This is overkill and also doesn't work well in because it increases the potential API surface. Plus, letting the validators warn it can't be easily used for logging, especially for custom validators.

So `.weak` is no longer needed: fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/863.

Backward compatibility for custom validators: since they didn't return anything and directly call `console.warn` or something, this doesn't break them.

Improvements:

  - `arrayOf`, `oneOfType` and `oneOf` got better message now, since they can get hold of their validator's message and output that instead of a generic `warning: bla`.
  - More complete tests, including testing custom types and `isRequired` on everything.

Bug fixes:

  - oneOfType(...).isRequired didn't work. The workaround was to use `oneOfType(a.isRequired, b.isRequired, ...)`. This means `oneOfType(a.isRequired, b)` doesn't make sense. The new version simply makes `oneOfType(...).isRequired` possible.
  - `oneOf([true])` worked for 'true' boolean because it converted everything to string before comparing. It no longer does.
- `oneOf([true]).isRequired` didn't work.

Browsers that natively support the `textInput` event appear to have a bug: when preventing default behavior for a `textInput` event occurring for a spacebar keypress, the character is prevented from being inserted **but the browser scrolls down**.

Minimal repro example: http://jsfiddle.net/salier/bX4fw/

This is ridiculous, since scrolling makes no sense when the user is focused in a textinput or contenteditable. Preventing default at the `textInput` stage should mean to prevent the character from being inserted, and should have no impact at all on scrolling behavior. I have filed this as a Chromium bug (https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=355103) but I'm not going to hold out much hope that they'll fix it.

To resolve this, I'm special-casing the spacebar character at the plugin level, in `BeforeInputEventPlugin`. I looked for ways to do this at the component level, but it seems to me that this is simply a browser bug and it's cleaner to handle it there.

In browsers that can use the native `textInput` event, I'm checking the code of the pressed key. If it's the spacebar, we dispatch the synthetic event as if there were no native `textInput` event -- as if we were running Firefox. Then, if the synthetic event is not canceled and we make it through to the native `textInput` event, bail if the character data is a space character."

This diff introduces `TextInputEventPlugin` and `SyntheticTextInputEvent`, which are based on Webkit's native `textInput` event.

In Chrome, Safari, and Opera, the `textInput` event fires prior to the insertion of character data into the document. For normal typing, for example, thevent sequence is: `keydown`, `keypress`, `textInput`, `input`, `keyup`. The `textInput` event contains a `data` field corresponding to the character data that will actually be inserted.

There is also a `beforeinput` event described by http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-type-beforeinput, and this is essentially that event, so it may make sense to rename the plugin.

This event is especially useful because it solves a number of issues we can't currently handle with only keypress and composition events:

  - **Windows Chrome: Trailing characters discarded in Korean IME.** For instance, `¾È³çÇÏ¼¼¿ä` becomes `¾È³çÇÏ¼¼` with the final character discarded by the final `compositionend` event. The `textInput` event fires correctly with the final character.
  - **Windows Chrome: Special characters discarded in IME.** Certain ideographs are discarded in IME mode. In Japanese, typing the ideographic space character is not represented by keypress but //is// represented by the subsequent `textInput`. This issue also applies to punctuation characters in Chinese.
  - **OSX Chrome: Characters from palette discarded.** Inserting characters from the OSX character palette fails, since no keypress is fired.

The plugin is useful for Firefox and IE. For these, we record inserted characters via keypress and compositionend events and dispatch the synthetic event with these characters as the `data` field to match the native `textInput` event.

  - Firefox has no corresponding `textInput` event and has not yet implemented `beforeinput`.
  - IE has a native `textinput` event, but it fires after the DOM mutation has already occurred, so it isn't very useful as an analog to the Webkit version. I'm just not going to bother with it."

It must be noted that this is not a complete fix. If you have multiple transitions on the element, it still ends when the first ends.

I ran into this not working (the transition ends almost immediately, because some unrelated transition ends). This fixes it for me, but I was wondering whether this cornercase was considered, and whether the other cornercase (multiple transitions) was considered.

I think it's very hard to get this correct, and think it might be better to make the timeout explicit, or at least allow to set it explicit, and fall back to this behaviour. But I'm really interested in feedback on this one."

The component that gets passed into renderComponent isn't guaranteed to be the
instance that gets mounted. We want to clone the instance.

Unit tests need to reason about the mounted instance. The first code mod changes:

  ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument(<identifier>)

into

  <identifier> = ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument(<identifier>)

Using this scripts:

  scripts/bin/codemod -m -d ~/www --extensions js \
   '^(\s*)ReactTestUtils\.renderIntoDocument\(\s*([$a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\s*\)' \
   '\1\2 = ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument(\2)'

In the second case I do the same for React.renderComponent. However, there are
alot more unnecessary matches so I only codemod if the same identifier occurs
later in the file.

  scripts/bin/codemod -m -d ~/www --extensions js \
   '^(\s*)React.renderComponent\(\s*([$a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\s*?,(.*?\n?.*?\s\2\b)' \
   '\1\2 = React.renderComponent(\2,\3'

And one more for ReactMount.renderComponent used by internals.

  scripts/bin/codemod -m -d ~/www --extensions js \
   '^(\s*)ReactMount.renderComponent\(\s*([$a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\s*?,(.*?\n?.*?\s\2\b)' \
   '\1\2 = ReactMount.renderComponent(\2,\3'

This still matches many unnecessary cases where the second occurance of the
identifier is a redeclaration or comment. But this code mod doesn't hurt in
those cases.

Finally I have to do the same for:

  this.<identifier> = React.renderComponent(this.<identifier>,

This is a common pattern for production code but not tests. Some of these call
sites will likely break when we move to true descriptors.

  scripts/bin/codemod -m -d ~/www --extensions js \
   '^(\s*)React.renderComponent\((\s*)this\.([$a-zA-Z0-9\_\.]+)\s*?,' \
   '\1this.\3 = React.renderComponent(\2this.\3,'"

This is the first step towards descriptors. This will start cloning the
component when it's mounted instead of mounting the first instance.

This avoids an issue where a reference to the first instance can hang around
in props. Since a mounted component gets mutated, the descriptor changes.

We don't need to clone the props object itself. Mutating the shallow props
object of a child that's passed into you is already flawed. Those cases need to
use cloneWithProps. A props object is considered shallow frozen after it leaves
the render it was created in."

reverts 23ab30ff873fba816129cafa0c40112dd2ee990d because the issue it fixed doesn't seem to be a problem
anymore. textContent should be better for more things anyway, as the
original 309a88bcf62c1c64a2b91c0eb753c19209a425b2 indicates. It should be faster because innerText
requires layout.

This also allows us to use strings with newlines in our rendered output
and have confidence that they will render the same on subsequent
re-renders. This is especially useful for es6-style backtick multi-line
strings. This will be more consistent as textContent is supported almost
everwhere so we won't have differing behavior between webkit and
firefox.

The key idea here is that you're always rendering `this.state.children`, not
`this.props.children`. When combined with `cloneWithProps()` this means we can
keep them in the DOM as long as we want. We add new children and reactively
update existing ones using `setState()` inside of `componentWillReceiveProps()`
so `this.state.children` always has the latest versions of components. Since we
may be keeping old components around that are no longer in
`this.props.children` we need a way to figure out where they should be inside
of the combined `this.state.children` list.  `ReactTransitionChildMapping` does
this for us.

Based on that infrastructure we can build the interface we always wanted: enter
and leave lifecycle hooks.

When a component is added to the DOM, `componentWillEnter(callback)` gets
called. Call the callback when you're done animating and `componentDidEnter()`
will be called.

When a component is about to be removed from the DOM,
`componentWillLeave(callback)` gets called. Call the callback when you're done
animating and `componentDidLeave()` will be called and the component will
*actually* be removed from the DOM. It won't be removed until you call the
callback.

These also handle ""concurrent"" changes. If you ""stack"" enter/leaves of a single
component before the animation has completed, it will block out all of those
animations until the current animation completes, and then finally it will
animate 0 or 1 times to get itself into the desired current state. This is what
differentiates `componentWillEnter()` from `componentDidMount()`.

The next step would be to build `componentDidReorder()`.

I've built `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` which is identical to the old
`ReactTransitionGroup` and codemodded the callsites."

We've been able to use `querySelectorAll` in all the browsers that we
support for some time now, but we haven't been able to test code that uses
it in the older version of `jsdom` that we were using, until recently.

Besides the general goal of modernizing our code, the impetus for this
specific change is that I'm trying to support testing without having to
render nodes into an actual document. The `.getElementsByName` method is
only defined on `document` and only works if the nodes you care about are
contained by the document.

On the other hand, `querySelectorAll` works on any DOM node, and allows a
more precise selection of just the `<input type=""radio"">` elements that
have the appropriate name.

IE8's implementation of `querySelectorAll` supports attribute-based
selectors, which is all we need here."

Test Plan:
On http://jsbin.com/OqOJidIQ/2/edit, got timings like

[75, 56, 30, 36, 27, 27, 28, 32, 27, 27, 28, 31]

instead of the old

[75, 729, 46, 32, 28, 34, 26, 27, 27, 30, 26, 26].

I also added a counter to getID and saw it was called 3014 times instead of the old 636264. (3014 is the number of nodes (3000) plus 3 calls that happen for the initial render and 1 for each of the 11 renders after that.)"

If you're writing a test that involves a mocked component that normally
returns a `<li>` tag from its `render` method as the root element, mocking
it with a dummy `<div>` probably won't work, so you'll want to set

  MyListItemComponent.mockTagName = 'li';

The change to the `.mockImplementation` line makes sense because
`ConvenienceConstructor` is more or less synonymous (for these purposes)
with the wrapper that was previously used:

  function() {
    // This `this` used to be `null`, technically, but
    // ConvenienceConstructor doesn't pay attention to `this` anyway.
    return ConvenienceConstructor.apply(this, arguments);

Pull request #526 updated the behavior of vendor/constants.js without
changing any source files or the bin/jsx-internal script, so files that
should have been rebuilt (like utils/__tests__/ImmutableObject-test.js)
were not automatically rebuilt (unless you knew to do `grunt clean` or
`rm -rf .module-cache` manually).

This commit allows us to bump a version number when we know the transform
toolchain has been altered in a way that will not be visible to
commoner/jsx.

With this convention, if we reset to an older revision (e.g. during a git
bisect) and the appropriate cached module files are still in the
.module-cache/, they can be used without rebuilding. That's why I prefer
this approach to just deleting the .module-cache/.

Closes #104.
Closes #496.
Closes #530."

When events are captured, the nearest React-rendered ancestor is found and events are propagated to its tree. This causes issues when components are nested as only the innermost component receives the events.

This change modifies this behaviour so events propagate all the way up the DOM hierarchy. To reduce the performance cost, this DOM traversal is only done if the component is actually nested (determined by the `containerIsNested` map which is lazily initialised)."

Summary:
adds `this.context` which you can think of as implicit props, which are passed automatically down the //ownership// hierarchy.

Contexts should be used sparingly, since they essentially allow components to communicate with descendants (in the ownership sense, not parenthood sense), which is not usually a good idea. You probably would only use contexts in places where you'd normally use a global, but contexts allow you to override them for certain view subtrees which you can't do with globals.

The context starts out `null`:

  var RootComponent = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      // this.context === null
    }
  });

You should **never** mutate the context directly, just like props and state.

You can change the context of your children (the ones you own, not `this.props.children` or via other props) using the new `withContext` method on `React`:

  var RootComponent = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      // this.context === null
      var children = React.withContext({foo: 'a', bar: 'b'}, () => (
        // In ChildComponent#render, this.context === {foo: 'a', bar: 'b'}
        <ChildComponent />
      ));
      // this.context === null
    }
  });

Contexts are merged, so a component can override its owner's context **for its children**:

  var ChildComponent = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      // this.context === {foo: 'a', bar: 'b'} (for the caller above)
      var children = React.withContext({foo: 'c'},() => (
        // In GrandchildComponent#render,
        // this.context === {foo: 'c', bar: 'b'}
        <GrandchildComponent />
      ));
      // this.context === {foo: 'a', bar: 'b'}
    }
  });"

- No need to mention React, you know you're working with it =).
- Wrap code elements in back ticks, so that they get the ""box"" styling for md.
- You'd want the snippet to work inside the live editor, so you need to `renderComponent`. As per wiki specification, the DOM element on which to mount is `mountNode`, just like on the front page.
- Don't forget the JSX pragma, or else your `render` fails.
- Nitpick: empty line after the end of md.
- No need for jQuery reference since
  1. The general mood around React is that you don't need jQuery.
  2. The syntax' still clear without jQuery.
  3. We're doing a jQuery integration entry =).
- `getInitialState` was absent.
- You don't need `componentWillMount` here. fetch them in `getInitialState`.
- The non-spoken convention seems to call the event handler `""handle"" + eventName`. So `handleResize` clearly indicates it's a `resize` handler while `updateDimensions` might do something else. This latter name might actually be better under circumstances where you use call the method directly somewhere, but since we removed the only direct usage in `componentWillMount` this is fine.
- Went OCD again and tried to keep the code short. `width` is enough of a demo. Removed `height`.
- Distinguish between DOM events and React events. Wish we go full React events in a near future."

Currently, default props as defined by `getDefaultProps` are only used if a prop is not specified (using `X in Y` check).

However, this makes it difficult for composing components to pass along the state of not being defined, for example:

  render: function() {
    // If `this.props.someProp` is not set, `InnerThing` should use the default value.
    return <InnerThing someProp={this.props.someProp} />;
  }

This changes the requirement for falling back to the default value to an undefined check (using `typeof X === 'undefined'`)."

This introduces `ReactLink` which is a super lightweight way to do two-way binding for React.

If you want to use a controlled form input today, it's a lot of lines of code:

http://jsfiddle.net/T3z3v/

Look how many times `name` is repeated in there. And you have to remember to wire up event handles and pass the right state and
right event handler for *each* form field. It's really annoying.

With ReactLink, you can ""link"" a form value to a state field. It's just some simple sugar around the value prop/onChange
convention:

https://gist.github.com/petehunt/6689857

Ah, much nicer! And requires very little core changes or extra bytes. `ReactLink` just wraps the current value and ""request
change"" handler into a little object and provides some sugar to create some from composite component state."

Jordan warned (and StackOverflow confirmed) that IE8 doesn't respect HTML
comment nodes when setting `.innerHTML`:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15006001/inserting-a-comment-in-innerhtml

The virtue of the comment strategy was that the parser did all the work of
maintaining the boundaries between markup chunks, using comments as the
boundary markers.  The new strategy (of tagging the first node with a
special attribute) has a similar virtue, since the parser should preserve
that attribute only for the nodes we care about, and any rendered nodes
that do not have the attribute can be ignored (and complained about by
`console.error`)."

Fixed:
- New todo not submitting correctly (page refreshes. `preventDefault`
wasn't there.
- Old checked todo being removed will leave the checkmark on the next
todo replacing its position.
- Cannot change todo (`value`'s now a controlled field).
- `autofocus` (should be `autoFocus`, how ironic given the current
situation) on new todo input isn't working. Switched to manual
`focus()` in `componentDidMount` for now.
- More consistent breathing space between lines.
- Gutter at 80.

Added:
- Use todomvc-common base.css. The old one had to change ids to
classes. No longer necessary.
- Give `cx` a better name and move it in `Utils`.
- Trim input upon finishing edit.
- Remove todo if the new edited value is empty.
- Submit edited todo value on input blur.
- README to explain the existence of this example. Being able to
maintain a non-compilant version allows nice deviations from the
todomvc specs, such as animations, in the future."

This introduces <ReactTransitionGroup>, a component that works a lot
like Angular's ng-animate.

The problem we're currently facing is twofold:
1. We don't really have a great convention surrounding CSS transitions
   in React
2. (harder) we can't animate nodes that are leaving the DOM, as their
   nodes are instantly destroyed.

To solve the first issue I've adopted Angular's convention. It's
implemented in ReactTransitionableChild.

The second part is what's tricky. To do this I've implemented three modules:
- ReactTransitionableChild, which can keep its old children around if they
  change to null
- ReactTransitionKeySet, which can look at a prev and next set of child
  keys and merge them in a reasonable way
- ReactTransitionGroup, which combines ReactTransitionableChild and
  ReactTransitionKeySet to keep nodes that are leaving the DOM in the
  DOM until their animations are complete"

This fixes a reconciliation bug introduced by adffa9b0f4128ca4832ddd03fdeca2c9fe434689.

The new unit test case exhibits the bug. When a component that has rendered child components is updated to render inline text, we usually:

 # Unmount and remove all child components.
 # Set the new inline text content.

However, with batched child operations, we do not **remove all child components** until later. The current implementation will set the inline text content and blow away those nodes, causing a fatal when `ReactMultiChild` later tries to find and remove those nodes.

This fixes the bug by ensuring that text content changes are also enqueued."

The original tests were flawed because the `Danger` module exploits the fact that all React-generated markup has at least one attribute. This allows the module to extract node names from markup strings faster.

However, the tests were passing in strings of markup with no attributes.

Also, this fixes a test failure due to the test trying to set text content into a `<tr>` which is typically disallowed by browsers (and PhantomJS). This changes it to use `<td>` instead."

Setting `innerHTML` is slow: http://jsperf.com/react-child-creation/2

This reduces the number of times we set `innerHTML` by batching markup generation in a component tree.

As usual, I cleaned up the `ReactMultiChild` module significantly.

== Children Reconciliation ==

When a `ReactNativeComponent` reconciles, it compares currently rendered children, `prevChildren`, with the new children, `nextChildren`. It figures out the shortest series of updates required to render `nextChildren` where each update is one of:

 - Create nodes for a new child and insert it at an index.
 - Update an existing node and, if necessary, move it to an index.
 - Remove an existing node.

This serializable series of updates is sent to `ReactDOMIDOperations` where the actions are actually acted on.

== Problem ==

There are two problems:

 # When a `ReactNativeComponent` renders new children, it sets `innerHTML` once for each contiguous set of children.
 # Each `ReactNativeComponent` renders its children in isolation, so two components that both render new children will do so separately.

For example, consider the following update:

  React.renderComponent(<div><p><span /></p><p><span /></p></div>, ...);
  React.renderComponent(<div><p><img /><span /><img /></p><p><img /><span /><img /></p></div>, ...);

This will trigger setting `innerHTML` four times.

== Solution ==

Instead of enqueuing the series of updates per component, this diff changes `ReactMultiChild` to enqueue updates per component tree (which works by counting recursive calls to `updateChildren`). Once all updates in the tree are accounted for, we render all markup using a single `innerHTML` set."

It's not always possible to update `rootElementsByReactRootID` when the

this bookkeeping is just trying to warn about potentially problematic

The latter is possible with controlled inputs when:

 - `onpropertychange` fires.
 - `ChangeEventPlugin` dispatches `onChange`.
 - A handler responds via `this.setState` with a non-string value (e.g. a number).
 - The input re-renders and re-sets `value`.
 - The new `value` is not a string, but the current `value` (read from the element) is cast to a string automatically by the browser.
 - This triggers another `onpropertychange`.
 - `ChangeEventPlugin` dispatches another `onChange`.

I still think the semantics of flattening children is valid but we'll
want to revert the flattening implementation while we solidify the
semantics and try another approach.

This reverts flattening so that this.props.children can once again be
either a single child, flat array or nested array.

mapChildren calls flattenChildren before doing anything else. This is
not the most efficient approach but I wanted to keep this inital diff
simple. It also ignores empty values for backwards compatibility.

We may want to try another approach where empty values are included
in the map.

Validation of keys is still done inside ReactComponent. Ideally I'd
like to extract that into a separate module but to avoid cyclic
dependencies, I'm keeping it in ReactComponent for now."

it could become a vulnerability. We fixed this by escaping just the keys.

A node is considered valid if it

  1. has the expected ID (more of a sanity check than something that is
     ever likely to go wrong), and

  2. is contained by a currently mounted container.

When these requirements are met, we can be confident that
`ReactMount.findReactRenderedDOMNodeSlow(node.id) === node`, which is
important for cache consistency because `findReactRenderedDOMNodeSlow` is
what we fall back to when we don't find a node in the cache.

Point 2 is a subtle requirement, because it allows nodes to be valid even
if they are not currently contained by a document. Rendering into a
detached node is okay, in other words (which is something that
`document.getElementById` never properly accounted for).

Containment testing takes linear time in the depth of the DOM, which
sounds unfortunate until you realize that virtually all browsers support a
native `ancestor.contains(descendant)` method, and in practice the vast
majority of nodes are either orphaned with `.parentNode === null` or not
very deep relative to their container."

This behavior seemed incorrect for composite components.

- isComponentMounted() represents ReactComponent's lifecycle of mounting
- isMounted() represents ReactCompositeComponent's lifecycle of isMounted()

Therefore, ReactComponents no longer have isMounted(). I think this is fine since it was not supposed to be public anyway."

Summary:
This is a proposal based loosely on the discussions I've had with @paulshen and @jwalke. It implements a shim for `React.DOM.input` (used as `<input>`) that supports two different use cases depending on whether `value` is provided or not.

If a `value` is //not// provided, the input will be initialized with the empty string (or `defaultValue`) and anytime the user changes the input, the `onChange` (or `onTextChange`) handler will be fired and the DOM will reflect the new changes.

  React.renderComponent(
    <input type=""text"" defaultValue=""Untitled"" onTextChange={handleChange} />,
    container
  );

If a `value` is provided, the input will be initialized to that value. Anytime the user changes the input, the `onChange` (or `onTextChange`) handler will be fired. However, the DOM will //not// reflect the new changes. If a `value` is provided, it is the responsibility of the owner to update the `value` prop passed in.

  var value = ""Untitled"";
  var input = React.renderComponent(
    <input type=""text"" value={value} onTextChange={handleChange} />,
    container
  );
  function handleChange(event) {
    // Do something cool like strip out non-numbers.
    var value = event.target.value.replace(/\D/g, '');
    input.setProps({value: value});
  }

This is just a start and we should build similar components for `textarea` and `select`. Also, this does not inject the new components because the changes are not backward compatible. Once we change all `<input>` uses to use `ReactDOMInput`, then we can inject."

This fixes the last known parts of the flattening experiment. This has grown to
be somewhat complex and potentially fragile because of it. We may end up
reverting flattening in the future or address it slightly differently.

The purpose of this diff is to test if we've finally understood the real world
edge cases that flattening can lead to and how we have to key components to
cover those cases.

With this commit we never rekey the internal _key property. The semantics is
that once a component passes through a composite component, it's identity is
frozen.

props.key should accept numeric values and booleans which includes 0 and false.
This fixes the truthiness check.

We should never warn about missing key properties if a component is passed as a
static child. The _key acts as a flag to determine whether this component
was checked already."

The biggest improvement is that we'll now insert each parsed JSX script
back into a `<script>` tag with the body set. This allows the browser to
execute these scripts normally. Using `Function(functionBody)` or
`eval(functionBody)` both execute in window scope, but `var` assignments
don't actually get set on window (unlike everywhere else).

I also did some cleanup to make the code a little bit more readable.

IE8 doesn't support oninput and IE9 supports it badly but we can do
almost a perfect shim by listening to a handful of different events
(focus, blur, propertychange, selectionchange, keyup, keydown).

This always triggers event handlers during the browser's event loop (not
later in a setTimeout) and after the value property has been updated.

The only case I know of where this doesn't fire the event immediately is
if (in IE8) you modify the input value using JS and then the user does a
key repeat, in which case we fire the event on the second keydown.

Test Plan:
Modify ballmer-peak example to add es5-shim and to use onTextChange
instead of onInput. In IE8, IE9, and latest Chrome, make sure that the
event is fired upon:

* typing normally,
* backspacing,
* forward-deleting,
* cutting,
* pasting,
* context-menu deleting,
* dragging text to reorder characters.

After modifying the example to change .value, make sure that the event
is not fired as a result of the changes from JS (even when the input box
is focused)."

 - Fallback to `mousewheel` event.

Also, since `wheel` is the standard event name, let's use that in React.

NOTE: The tricky part was detecting if `wheel` is supported for IE9+ because `onwheel` does not exist.

Test Plan:
Execute the following in the console on a page with React:

  var React = require('React');
  React.renderComponent(React.DOM.div({
    style: {
      width: 10000,

Summary:
This makes a few changes to React Core, most notably `ReactEventEmitter` and `ReactEventTopLevelCallback`.

 - Changed `ReactEventEmitter` to use `EventListener` (instead of `NormalizedEventListener`).
 - Deleted `NormalizedEventListener` (which was previously broken).
 - Created `getEventTarget` which is used to get a normalized `target` from a native event.
 - Changed `ReactEventTopLevelCallback` to use `getEventTarget`.
 - Renamed `abstractEventType` to `reactEventType` in `AbstractEvent`.
 - Reanmed `abstractTargetID` to `reactTargetID` in `AbstractEvent`.
 - Removed `originatingTopLevelEventType` from `AbstractEvent` (unused and violates encapsulation).
 - Removed `nativeEvent.target === window` check when refreshing authoritative scroll values (unnecessary).

This actually fixes React because `NormalizedEventListener` does not currently do what it promises to do (which is normalizing `target` on the native event). The `target` event is read-only on native events.

This also revises documentation and adds `@typechecks` to a few modules.

NOTE: Most importantly, this sets the stage for replacing `AbstractEvent` with `ReactEvent` and subclasses, piecemeal."

Instead I reassign the _key every time it passes through a flattening.
This means that it's unique and stable for a single pass through a composite
component. When it's repassed another level, it loses it previous
identity and is rekeyed by it's new location.

For auto-generated keys by index, this actually means it has the same
semantics as before flattening.

For explicit keys, it has the effect that keys need to be unique at

is also inline with the old semantics but less intuitive in the new model."

Some improvements to how style={{x:y}} is handled in React:
* ignores null styles, rather than setting them.

Codez:

    var highlighted = false;
    <div style={{color: highlighted ? 'red' : null}} />

Before:

    <div style=""color:;""></div>

After:

This expects static children as additional arguments to the constructor
and flattens any array arguments one level deep.

Component(props, child1, child2, arrayOfChildren, child3) ->
.props.children = [child1, child2, ...arrayOfChildren, child3]

This can avoid an additional heap allocation for the unflat array.

It allows you to pass nested arrays and objects like you used to. Those
aren't immediately flattened. That makes this a fairly safe change.

Passing a dynamic array without key properties will yield a warning
(once). Might consider throwing later.

Once we change the transpiler to use the new syntax, you'll end up with
a single flat array in normal usage.

This doesn't actually update the JSX transform."

Ship CJS modules instead of browserified build"
"7231","0c6bbf275bb14a0b37426a5caf3dfd31753d36f3","2013-05-31T17:57:40Z","Paul O<U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD>Shannessy","paul@oshannessy.com","zpao","Paul O<U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD>Shannessy","paul@oshannessy.com","zpao","Ship CJS modules instead of browserified build

It turns out that if you try to browserify a file requiring react-tools,
it doesn't work. This is because browserify just visits the require
statements in the file and looks for files in that path.
./ReactCompositeComponent doesn't exist and that's the point that fails.
So the fix is to actually ship each of our CJS modules as individual
files like browserify expects. This should have no negative side effects
- we still only export React (though the rest of our modules are now
actually accessible, which might make it easier to do more with the
module).

The other change here is to move source-map to dependencies since it's
required in the transform code.

Test Plan:

```
$ npm pack .
$ cd /tmp
$ npm install path/to/react-tools-0.3.1.tgz
$ echo ""require('react-tools')"" > test.js
$ browserify test.js
```"
